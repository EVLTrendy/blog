How is AI changing job searching on LinkedIn?

AI's role in modern technological solutions is expanding rapidly. Beyond powering smart assistants and driving predictive analytics in car sales, giants like LinkedIn and Microsoft are leading the integration of AI to transform professional activities and business operations.

While these tech leaders push the AI frontier, concerns about impacts on employment, privacy, and technological development persist as critical areas of discussion.
