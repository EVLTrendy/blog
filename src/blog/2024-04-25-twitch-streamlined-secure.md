Want a better online experience? Well, the latest updates to Twitch to keep your community safe.

As a community, we need to follow some important rules and guidelines on Twitch to ensure the safety and enjoyment of everyone on the platform.

We have strict rules against promoting or glorifying self-harm, violence, threats, terrorism, violent extremism, sexual violence and exploitation, and any content that puts our younger users at risk. We do not support or encourage any harmful acts.

Our rules also extend beyond the platform. Any behavior that causes harm to our community will not be tolerated, including sharing someone's personal information without their permission.

We do not tolerate any form of discrimination, harassment, or violence based on someone's race, gender, or any other protected characteristic. Any kind of harassment, including sexual harassment, is strictly prohibited.

Impersonating someone else, spamming, and scams are also not allowed. Let’s keep things legitimate and trustworthy.

Lastly, let’s keep things truthful and reliable. Spreading harmful misinformation is not acceptable.

### Mobile Experience Redesign:

Twitch is receiving a significant update on mobile devices, and it’s been a long time coming! These updates will make browsing through streams feel like a breeze.

Let's start with the discovery feed, which is your new go-to spot when you open the app. You’ll find a personalized buffet of live streams and clips tailored just for you. Whether you're catching up on your favorite streamers or discovering something new, this feed has got you covered.

But that's not all! Twitch stories are also getting an overhaul. You can now share quick updates with your friends straight from your phone. This includes short video stories and some cool updates like pinch-to-zoom for photos. Additionally, we're adding portrait clips to make your stories more interesting.

Now, let's talk about support. We know you love showing support to your favorite streamers, so we’re making it easier than ever on mobile. We’re giving subs, gifts, and Bits a facelift, along with some mobile-specific tweaks to features like Hype Train. Supporting your faves should be a breeze, not a hassle.

Finally, mod power! Until now, mod tools were only available on desktops, but that's about to change. Mobile Mod View is coming to iOS, which means you can keep your community safe on the go.

### Social Media Integration:

Introducing Twitch's Clip Editor tool, which allows you to easily share your finest Twitch moments on social media platforms. With this application, you can easily edit your live stream highlights directly from your Twitch dashboard, without the need for any sophisticated software. The Clip Editor provides a simple and user-friendly editing experience.

One of the most intriguing features of the Clip Editor is its adaptability. You may easily adapt your movies to numerous sites such as Instagram, TikTok, and Twitter, highlighting your major game achievements or humorous stream moments. The Clip Editor also allows full-screen or split-screen layouts, and you may resize and rearrange elements to create the perfect clip.

The Clip Editor can help you boost your Twitch channel's traffic and notoriety. You can put your Twitch handle in your clips so that viewers can discover you.

Twitch is constantly working on upgrades and improvements to the Clip Editor, and it is web-based, so you can use it from any desktop platform. Mobile functionality for the Clip Editor is coming soon!

So, if you're ready to step up your content-sharing game, try the Clip Editor and watch your audience expand. Happy editing!

### Collaboration Enhancement:

Collaboration is one of the most effective ways for a streamer to expand and reach new audiences. This year, we will continue to make them easier, more enjoyable, and rewarding for you. We'll be upgrading Stream Together, which is presently in testing and allows up to six broadcasters to go live simultaneously on their respective channels. We're making it more straightforward to set up, as well as to discover and collaborate with other Twitch streamers on the go. We'll also be adding ways to mix chats and viewership, allowing you to create unique and fun cross-community moments with other broadcasters. 

Monetization: Expanding revenue opportunities for streamers through Twitch Plus, ads programs, and creator sponsorships.

### New Changes to Monetization:

Twitch has made many changes to help streamers make more money. They have enlarged their Plus program, formerly known as the Partner Plus program, to allow more streams to get higher revenue percentages. Additionally, they have reduced the intrusiveness of adverts while still allowing streamers to benefit from them.

Twitch is also increasing its sponsorship portfolio by signing up new companies to sponsor streams. This means that we will all have more alternatives for earning extra money.

Twitch is also giving fans more ways to support their favorite streamers. This introduces new milestones and incentives, such as applause, gifts, and subscriptions. They are also introducing new interactions with Bits to the Hype Train.

Finally, Twitch is hiking its prices in various markets, including Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom. This is the first time they've done this since the launch of subscriptions, but they're doing it to help streamers keep up with escalating costs.

### Conclusion:

Twitch's latest developments promise an exciting future for both streamers and spectators. The emphasis on safety and community norms creates a more positive and welcoming environment for all. 

The updated mobile app offers a more streamlined and user-friendly experience, making it easier than ever to discover new content and support your favorite streamers while on the go. Creators now have more ways to interact with their audience and develop their channels than ever before, thanks to innovations like the Clip Editor tool and collaborative enhancements. While changes to subscription fees may raise some eyebrows, the goal is clear: to help streamers prosper.

 So, whether you're a seasoned Twitch veteran or just starting, these changes will improve your Twitch experience. Get ready to plunge in and discover everything Twitch has to offer!
