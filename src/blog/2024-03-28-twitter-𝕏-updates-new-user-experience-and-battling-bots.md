Twitter, now known as 𝕏, has experienced substantial modifications since its acquisition by Elon Musk in October 2022. These improvements have resulted in new features, policies, and tactics targeted at improving the user experience and tackling emergent issues.



Keeping up with platform changes is crucial for both users and businesses. Users can benefit from accessing new features, increasing engagement, and easily navigating the platform. Similarly, understanding and implementing platform upgrades enables businesses to change their marketing strategies, capitalize on new opportunities, and stay ahead of the competition.



While some users praised the new features and improved authentication mechanism, others decried the layoffs and senior departures, raising concerns about the platform's future direction.

### Addressing Bot Activity

Bot activity is a major concern on social media networks like Twitter. Bots are automated accounts that are programmed to do a variety of functions, such as disseminating spam and misinformation, altering trends, and tracking engagement metrics. Their existence may weaken the legitimacy of user interactions and disrupt the platform's dynamics.



To address this issue, Twitter provided discussion settings for posts. These choices allow users to choose who can answer to their tweets, decreasing the potential of bots disrupting conversations. Twitter hopes that by allowing users to control their conversations, the platform will generate more meaningful and authentic engagement.



In addition to chat settings, Twitter has introduced several techniques to limit and identify bot accounts. This involves refining algorithms for identifying and suspending suspect accounts, streamlining account verification processes, and working with researchers and specialists to create better bot detection technologies. By constantly refining its strategy to combat bot activity, Twitter aims to create a safer and more authentic environment for users to connect and exchange content.









### New User Experience

𝕏 has released a new function that allows Android users to modify video playback speed to their tastes. This feature gives consumers greater control over their watching experience, allowing them to absorb content at their own pace. 𝕏 strives to improve accessibility and meet varied user needs, including the ability to speed up or slow down videos for greater comprehension.

Additionally, 𝕏 provides premium and premium+ features for accounts with large followings. These subscription-based services offer additional capabilities such as extensive analytics, specific content creation tools, and priority customer assistance. 𝕏 provides premium features for artists and influencers to increase engagement, as well as management and monetization solutions.

The introduction of premium and premium+ features for accounts with substantial followings is a valuable addition to the platform, providing content creators and influencers with extra tools and resources. These capabilities allow users to have a better understanding of their audience, develop high-quality content, and efficiently monetize their platform presence. 𝕏 improves customer satisfaction and creates a more engaging community by responding to their requirements.

Twitter | 𝕏's recent improvements and adjustments caused negative feedback from users and businesses. While some people welcome the new features aimed at improving user experience and combatting bot activity, others are concerned about the impact on freedom of expression and community dynamics.



Businesses and organizations have reacted differently to the updates, with some using new features and subscription options to improve their presence and engage with their audience, while others are concerned about changes in verification policies and the introduction of premium features.



Several case studies show how users and businesses adapt to changes on Twitter | 𝕏 by experimenting with new advertising alternatives, maintaining a devoted following, and employing advanced analytics to optimize their marketing strategy. To remain relevant and engaged on the platform, organizations must navigate the ever-changing landscape of online communication and community management.

Just look at what the Departments of the Victoria, Australia state government had to say

"The Department of Jobs, Skills, Industry, and Regions has taken steps to close its X social media account, as confirmed recently. Citing a decline in engagement, a department spokesperson stated, 'We regularly review our communication channels to ensure we're speaking to Victorians on their preferred channels - our audience's engagement with the X (formerly Twitter) account has declined, so we are moving towards closing this account.'

According to Guardian Australia, all state government departments are currently evaluating their presence on the platform. It is anticipated that only essential accounts such as those managed by the Department of Health and the Department of Transport will persist, given their responsibility for providing critical updates on public health information and transportation disruptions.
