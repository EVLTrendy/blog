# Frontmatter Template for Blog Posts

Use this template when creating new blog posts to ensure proper YAML formatting and avoid validation errors.

## Required Format

```markdown
---
title: "Your Post Title Here"
description: "A compelling description that is at least 50 characters long and describes what readers will learn or gain from this post"
date: "2025-12-07T20:03:48.097Z"
author: "Author Name"
image: "/assets/blog/your-image-file.png"
imageAlt: "Description of what the image shows for accessibility"
tags:
  - post
  - featured
  - your-topic
keywords: "keyword1, keyword2, keyword3"
schema_type: "Article"
og_type: "article"
---

# Your Post Title Here

Your post content goes here...
```

## Critical Rules

### ✅ Date Format (MUST FOLLOW EXACTLY)
```yaml
# CORRECT - Properly quoted ISO string
date: "2025-12-07T20:03:48.097Z"

# WRONG - Will cause Netlify build errors
date: 2025-12-07T20:03:48.097Z
date: "2025-12-07T20:03:48"  # Missing milliseconds
date: 2025-12-07  # Missing time
```

### ✅ Required Fields (All must be present)
- `title` - Your post title (minimum 10 characters)
- `description` - Post description (minimum 50 characters)
- `image` - Path to post image (must start with `/assets/`)

### ✅ Optional but Recommended Fields
- `author` - Author name
- `imageAlt` - Alt text for accessibility
- `tags` - Array of tags (include "post" and "featured" for visibility)
- `keywords` - Comma-separated keywords for SEO

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### ❌ Don't use unquoted dates
```yaml
# This will break Netlify builds
date: 2025-12-07T20:03:48.097Z
```

### ❌ Don't use concatenated dates
```yaml
# This will cause parsing errors
date: "2025-12-07T20:03:48.000Z""2025-12-07T20:03:48.097Z"
```

### ❌ Don't use multiline descriptions without escaping
```yaml
# This can cause YAML parsing issues
description: "Line 1
Line 2"
```

### ❌ Don't omit required fields
```yaml
# Missing required fields will cause build failures
---
title: "Title Only"
# Missing description, image, etc.
---
```

## Validation Commands

Run these commands to validate your frontmatter:

```bash
# Check for issues (read-only)
npm run validate

# Auto-fix issues
npm run validate:fix

# Debug YAML parsing differences
npm run validate:yaml

# Direct YAML fixes
npm run fix:yaml
```

## GitHub Desktop Workflow

1. Create new post using this template
2. Fill in all required fields
3. Commit and push to trigger GitHub Actions validation
4. Check PR comments for any auto-fixes or errors
5. Review auto-fixed files before merging

## Troubleshooting

### "Date format is invalid" Error
- Ensure date is quoted: `"2025-12-07T20:03:48.097Z"`
- Include milliseconds: `.097Z` not just `.000Z`
- Use ISO 8601 format: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ`

### "Missing required fields" Error
- Check that `title`, `description`, and `image` are all present
- Ensure `description` is at least 50 characters
- Verify `image` path starts with `/assets/`

### Netlify Build Fails
- Run `npm run validate:fix` locally first
- Check that all dates are properly quoted strings
- Ensure no special characters in field values

## Template Shortcuts

### Quick Date (Update with current date)
```yaml
date: "2025-12-07T20:03:48.097Z"
```

### Common Tags (Copy and modify)
```yaml
tags:
  - post
  - featured
  - tiktok
  - youtube
  - instagram
  - social-media
  - content-creation
```

### SEO Keywords (Customize for your post)
```yaml
keywords: "content creation, social media, digital marketing, blogging, SEO"
```
